# Model Capability Documentation Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive updates made to Gary-Zero's model documentation and configuration to ensure accurate representation of AI model capabilities and adherence to the latest standards.

## Key Updates Completed

### 1. Model Catalog Updates (`framework/helpers/model_catalog.py`)

✅ **Removed Incorrect Entries**:
- Removed `computer-use-preview` from OpenAI models (it's a capability, not a model)

✅ **Added Missing Models**:
- OpenAI: Added GPT-4.1 series, transcription models, tool-specific models
- Google: Added CLI models (`gemini-cli-chat`, `gemini-cli-code`)
- Groq: Added Moonshot AI and Qwen models
- New providers: xAI (Grok models), Perplexity (Sonar models), Qwen

✅ **Final Model Count**: 47 models across 7 providers

### 2. Default Settings Updates (`framework/helpers/settings/types.py`)

✅ **Updated Defaults**:
- Chat model: `claude-sonnet-4-0` (was `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- Code model: `claude-sonnet-4-0` (was `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- Kept other defaults as appropriate

### 3. New Documentation Created

#### `docs/model-capabilities.md`
Comprehensive guide explaining:
- Distinction between models and tools/capabilities
- Computer use is a tool capability, not a model
- Capability matrix showing which models support what
- Configuration examples
- Best practices for capability selection

#### `docs/computer-use-guide.md`
Detailed guide covering:
- What computer use is and how it works
- Supported models (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o)
- Configuration and setup
- Usage examples and templates
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting

#### `docs/mcp-integration.md`
Complete MCP guide including:
- Architecture overview
- Built-in MCP servers (filesystem, GitHub, memory, etc.)
- Creating custom MCP servers
- Integration examples
- Best practices and security

### 4. Updated Existing Documentation

#### `docs/ai-models.md`
Modernized to include:
- Clear warning that "computer use" is not a model
- Quick reference with recommended defaults
- Comprehensive provider and model listings
- Model selection by use case
- Important clarifications about capabilities vs models

## Key Clarifications Made

### Computer Use is a Tool Capability

**Before**: Confusion with `computer-use-preview` listed as a model
**After**: Clear documentation that computer use is a capability available with:
- Claude Sonnet 4 (via Anthropic's Computer Use API)
- GPT-4o models (via tool integrations)

### Model Capabilities Documentation

**Added comprehensive documentation of**:
- Which models support computer use
- Web search capabilities (native vs MCP)
- Code execution options
- Vision and voice support
- MCP compatibility

### MCP Integration

**Documented**:
- How MCP extends capabilities to ALL models
- Built-in servers and their tools
- Custom server creation
- Security best practices

## Configuration Updates

### Recommended Model Configuration

```python
# Chat and Code
"chat_model_provider": "ANTHROPIC",
"chat_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-0",
"code_model_provider": "ANTHROPIC",
"code_model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-0",

# Utility (fast tasks)
"util_model_provider": "OPENAI",
"util_model_name": "gpt-4.1-mini",

# Computer Use Settings
"computer_use_enabled": True,
"computer_use_require_approval": False,
"computer_use_screenshot_interval": 1.0,
"computer_use_max_actions_per_session": 50
```

## Impact and Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Clear distinction between models and capabilities
2. **Accuracy**: All models verified against latest documentation
3. **Usability**: Comprehensive guides for implementing capabilities
4. **Flexibility**: MCP integration allows extending any model
5. **Security**: Best practices and safety guidelines included

## Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `framework/helpers/model_catalog.py` - Updated model listings
- ✅ `framework/helpers/settings/types.py` - Updated default models
- ✅ `docs/model-capabilities.md` - NEW comprehensive capability guide
- ✅ `docs/computer-use-guide.md` - NEW computer use implementation guide
- ✅ `docs/mcp-integration.md` - NEW MCP server guide
- ✅ `docs/ai-models.md` - Updated with modern model information

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify all models work with updated configuration
2. **Training**: Share new documentation with team
3. **Monitoring**: Track usage of new capabilities
4. **Feedback**: Collect user feedback on documentation clarity
