# Railway Deployment Timeout Fix - Issue #64

## Problem Resolved

Railway deployment was failing with Docker registry timeout:

```
failed to do request: Head "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/python/manifests/3.11-slim": dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io: i/o timeout
```

## Root Cause

Railway was attempting to use Docker for builds instead of the intended Nixpacks configuration, causing dependency on Docker Hub registry which experienced connectivity issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Configuration Changes

**Renamed Dockerfile to Dockerfile.local**
- Prevents Railway from auto-detecting Docker as the build method
- Preserves Docker configuration for local development

**Updated nixpacks.toml**:

```toml
[providers]
python = "3.11"

[build]
buildCommand = "pip install -r requirements.txt"

[start]
cmd = "python run_ui.py --port $PORT --host 0.0.0.0 --dockerized"
```

**Enhanced railway.toml** - Added explicit Python version:

```toml
[services.variables]
NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"
```

**Updated railway.json** - Added consistent Python version specification

**Created .railway-ignore** - Explicitly excludes Docker files from Railway builds

### 2. Benefits of This Fix

1. **Eliminates Docker Registry Dependency** - Nixpacks builds don't require external registry access
2. **Consistent Python Version** - All configs now use Python 3.11
3. **Faster Builds** - Nixpacks typically builds faster than Docker
4. **Better Railway Integration** - Uses Railway's preferred build system

## Deployment Instructions

### For New Deployments

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway deploy

# Monitor deployment logs
railway logs --follow

# Verify service is running
railway status
```

### For Existing Deployments

```bash
# Redeploy with new configuration
railway up

# Check environment variables
railway variables list

# Verify health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

## Health Check Verification

The application provides a health endpoint at `/health`:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Test it with:

```bash
curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check Builder Configuration**:

   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   ```

   Look for "Using Nixpacks" in build logs.

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   railway variables list
   ```

   Ensure `NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11` is set.

3. **Check for Docker Detection**:
   If logs show Docker usage, verify:
   - No `Dockerfile` in repository root
   - `.railway-ignore` contains Docker exclusions

4. **Force Nixpacks Usage**:

   ```bash
   railway variables set NIXPACKS_BUILDER=true
   railway deploy
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Builder not found"
**Solution**: Ensure `railway.json` specifies `"builder": "nixpacks"`

**Issue**: "Python version mismatch"
**Solution**: Verify all config files use Python 3.11

**Issue**: "Port binding failed"
**Solution**: Ensure health endpoint is accessible and app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

## Validation Commands

Check configuration validity:

```bash
# Validate JSON files
python -m json.tool railway.json

# Check for conflicts
ls -la | grep -i docker

# Test locally (if dependencies installed)
python run_ui.py --port 8080 --host 127.0.0.1
```

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in future:
1. Always use Nixpacks for Railway deployments
2. Keep Docker files named with `.local` or `.dev` suffix
3. Maintain `.railway-ignore` to exclude build artifacts
4. Test deployments in Railway's staging environment first

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Railway now successfully deploys using Nixpacks without Docker registry dependencies.
