# Agent OS Specifications Directory

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for Gary-Zero features and capabilities. These specifications are used by agents to understand implementation requirements and ensure consistent development.

## Purpose

- **Agent Reference**: Provides definitive specifications for AI agents to reference
- **Implementation Guide**: Detailed technical requirements for development
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures features meet architectural and user requirements
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple agents to work on related features consistently

## Directory Structure

```
.agent-os/specs/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── core/                        # Core framework specifications
├── agents/                      # Agent-specific feature specs
├── integrations/               # External service integration specs
├── ui/                         # User interface specifications
└── infrastructure/             # Railway deployment and infrastructure specs
```

## Specification Format

Each specification follows the template defined in `.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md` and includes:

1. **Feature Overview**: Purpose, scope, and priority
2. **Technical Specification**: Architecture, components, and data flow
3. **Implementation Details**: Dependencies, configuration, and security
4. **User Interface**: Web UI, CLI, and API requirements
5. **Integration Points**: MCP protocol and service connections
6. **Acceptance Criteria**: Functional and non-functional requirements

## File Naming Convention

- Format: `feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD-v#.md`
- Example: `agent-memory-system-2025-01-27-v1.md`
- Include version number for iterations
- Use kebab-case for feature names

## Git Handling

**Important**: This directory is excluded from git commits via `.gitignore` to:
- Prevent specification churn in version control
- Allow agents to create and modify specs freely
- Keep working specifications separate from committed documentation
- Enable rapid iteration without commit noise

However, the directory structure itself is tracked so agents can discover it.

## Agent Usage

Agents should:
1. Check this directory for existing specifications before creating new features
2. Create new specifications using `/create-spec` command
3. Reference specifications during implementation with `/execute-tasks`
4. Update specifications as features evolve
5. Use specifications for quality assurance and testing

## Quality Standards

All specifications must:
- Align with Gary-Zero's Railway cloud architecture
- Support multi-agent cooperation patterns
- Include MCP protocol integration points
- Consider connected services (Kali, E2B, Computer Use, Morphism)
- Address security and performance requirements
- Include comprehensive testing criteria

## Maintenance

- Specifications should be kept current with implementation
- Outdated specifications should be archived or removed
- Version increments should reflect significant changes
- Dependencies between specifications should be documented

This directory serves as the single source of truth for Gary-Zero feature specifications, enabling consistent and coordinated development across all agents and contributors.
