# Agent Workflows


## Overview

This document defines the standard workflows and coordination patterns for agent interactions.


## Workflow Types

### Sequential Workflows

- **Description:** [Linear sequence of agent tasks]
- **Use Cases:** [When to use sequential workflows]
- **Implementation:** [Technical implementation details]

### Parallel Workflows

- **Description:** [Concurrent execution of agent tasks]
- **Use Cases:** [When to use parallel workflows]
- **Implementation:** [Technical implementation details]

### Conditional Workflows

- **Description:** [Branching logic based on conditions]
- **Use Cases:** [When to use conditional workflows]
- **Implementation:** [Technical implementation details]


## Standard Workflow Patterns

### Request-Response Pattern

```
Agent A -> Request -> Agent B
Agent B -> Response -> Agent A
```

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern

```
Agent A -> Publish Event -> Message Broker
Message Broker -> Notify -> [Agent B, Agent C, Agent D]
```

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

```
Request -> Agent A -> Agent B -> Agent C -> Response
```


## Workflow Configuration

### Workflow Definition Schema

```yaml
workflow:
  id: "workflow-001"
  name: "Data Processing Pipeline"
  version: "1.0.0"
  steps:
    - agent: "data-ingestion-agent"
      action: "ingest"
      parameters: {}
    - agent: "data-processing-agent"
      action: "process"
      parameters: {}
```

### Error Handling

- [Define error handling strategies]
- [Retry policies and backoff strategies]
- [Failure notification procedures]


## Monitoring and Observability

### Workflow Metrics

- [Key performance indicators for workflows]
- [Success/failure rates]
- [Execution time measurements]

### Logging Requirements

- [Structured logging format for workflows]
- [Required log levels and content]
- [Log retention policies]
