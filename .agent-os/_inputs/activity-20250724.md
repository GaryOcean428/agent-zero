## 🚀 Major Themes & Patterns

### 1. **Railway Deployment Modernization** 🎯

- **Migration from Nixpacks to Railpack** achieving 37-77% smaller images
- Implementation of standardized build/start scripts
- Configuration consolidation into single source of truth (`railpack.json`)
- Deprecation of legacy deployment files (`railway.toml`, `nixpacks.toml`)

### 2. **Agent OS Product Development** 🤖

- Comprehensive agent guidelines and sanitization scripts
- Product documentation initialization
- Validation scripts for deployment configurations

### 3. **Model Catalog Modernization** 🧠

- Complete overhaul prioritizing post-June 2024 models (145 total: 100 modern, 43 deprecated)
- Addition of specialized models: Claude Sonnet 3.7, Google Gemini CLI, Qwen 3 Coder, Kimi K2 Instruct
- Removal of 43 legacy models from frontend/backend
- Enhanced voice and code model support

### 4. **MCP Protocol Integration** 🔌

- **[SPEC-RELEVANT]** Migration to shared_mcp library for cross-repository reuse
- MCP handler compatibility improvements
- Standardization of MCP implementation patterns

### 5. **Security & Reliability Enhancements** 🔒

- Implementation of internal secret store with encryption
- Git workflow validation system preventing uncommitted deployments
- Comprehensive error handling and browser/Node.js compatibility fixes

---


## 🔥 Critical Fixes & Improvements

### **Browser/Node.js Environment Compatibility**

- Fixed `process is not defined` errors in error-boundary.js
- Added missing `/api/error_report` endpoint (405 Method Not Allowed resolution)
- Environment-safe error boundary implementation
- Alpine.js initialization timing fixes

### **Git Workflow Validation System**

- Pre-commit hooks with Git status validation
- CI/CD pipeline integration preventing deployment of uncommitted changes
- Multi-layer protection mechanisms (pre-commit, CI/CD, manual, documentation)

### **Railway Deployment Stability**

- Fixed PORT environment variable handling
- PortAudio system dependencies for pyaudio
- FastAPI missing dependency resolution
- Node.js version mismatch corrections
