## Current Product Status

- **Version**: 0.9.0 (Beta)
- **Architecture**: Railway-managed cloud-native deployment
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Stability & Polish (Q1 2025)


## Product Planning Guidelines

### 1. Align with Gary-Zero Mission

- Democratize AI agent development
- Provide transparent, customizable, and extensible platform
- Support complex task automation through multi-agent cooperation
- Maintain Railway cloud-first architecture

### 2. Consider Core Differentiators

- Railway-managed infrastructure (not Docker-first)
- Hierarchical agent structure
- MCP protocol integration

### 3. Target User Segments

- **Developers**: Rapid AI application prototyping
- **Researchers**: Multi-agent interaction studies
- **Business Users**: Automated workflows without coding
- **Security Professionals**: Cybersecurity and penetration testing

### 4. Technical Constraints

- Python 3.13+ requirement
- Railway.com deployment platform
- FastAPI async web framework
- WebSocket real-time communication
- Cloud-distributed storage (not local file system)


## Planning Process

### Step 1: Roadmap Alignment

Review current roadmap position and align new features with:
- Phase 1: Stability & Polish (Current)
- Phase 2: Advanced Features (Q2 2025)
- Phase 3: Enterprise & Scale (Q3 2025)
- Phase 4: Agent OS Integration (Q4 2025)

### Step 2: Architecture Consideration

Ensure all planning considers:
- Railway's managed containerization
- Cloud-native storage solutions
- Service-to-service communication via Railway private network
- Scalability through Railway's managed services

### Step 3: User Experience Focus

Prioritize:
- Transparency in agent decision-making
- Customization and extensibility
- Security and safe execution
- Community-driven development


## Output Format

Product plans should include:
1. **Feature Description**: Clear explanation of functionality
2. **User Value**: How it serves target user segments
3. **Technical Approach**: Railway-compatible implementation
4. **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes
5. **Dependencies**: Required infrastructure or integrations
6. **Timeline**: Alignment with roadmap phases


## Next Steps

After planning, use:
- `/create-spec` to develop detailed specifications
