# Create Specification - Gary-Zero Agent Framework


## Context

This instruction guides the creation of detailed technical specifications for Gary-Zero features, ensuring alignment with Railway cloud architecture and agent framework principles.


## Specification Standards

### 1. Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: Railway.com managed deployment
- **Runtime**: Python 3.13+ with FastAPI async framework
- **Storage**: Cloud-distributed storage, Railway volumes for persistence
- **Communication**: WebSocket real-time, MCP protocol integration
- **Security**: Railway isolation, E2B sandboxing, input validation

### 2. Architecture Principles

- **Cloud-Native**: Design for Railway's managed environment
- **Agent-Centric**: Support hierarchical multi-agent cooperation
- **Service Integration**: Leverage connected services (Kali, E2B, Morphism)
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for community contributions
- **Transparent**: Full visibility into agent decision-making

### 3. User Experience Requirements

- **Developers**: Rapid prototyping with extensive customization
- **Researchers**: Framework for studying multi-agent interactions
- **Business Users**: Workflow automation without coding expertise
- **Security Professionals**: Cybersecurity tools and penetration testing


## Specification Template

### Feature Overview

- **Name**: Clear, descriptive feature name
- **Purpose**: Problem being solved and user value
- **Scope**: What's included and excluded
- **Priority**: Roadmap phase alignment

### Technical Specification

- **Architecture**: How it fits in Railway cloud environment
- **Components**: Services, modules, and integrations required
- **Data Flow**: Information flow between components
- **APIs**: External interfaces and MCP protocol usage
- **Storage**: Data persistence strategy using cloud services

### Implementation Details

- **Dependencies**: Required services and libraries
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and Railway settings
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and sandboxing
- **Performance**: Scalability and optimization considerations
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test requirements

### User Interface

- **Web UI**: Frontend components and user interactions
- **CLI**: Command-line interface requirements
- **API**: External API endpoints and documentation
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication patterns

### Integration Points

- **MCP Protocol**: Agent interoperability requirements
- **Railway Services**: Connected service communication
- **External APIs**: Third-party service integrations
- **Plugin System**: Extension points for customization

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Functional**: What the feature must do
- **Non-Functional**: Performance, security, usability requirements
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling and boundary conditions
- **Compatibility**: Railway environment and version requirements


## Quality Gates

### Technical Review

- Railway cloud compatibility
- Agent framework alignment
- Security best practices
- Performance considerations

### User Experience Review

- Target user segment needs
- Transparency and customization
- Documentation requirements
- Community contribution potential


## Output Location

Specifications should be created in:
- `.agent-os/specs/` directory (not committed to git)
- Named with feature-date format: `feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Include version tracking for iterations


## Next Steps

After specification creation:
- Review with technical stakeholders
- Validate against roadmap priorities
- Use `/execute-tasks` for implementation
- Update documentation in `.agent-os/product/`

This instruction ensures all specifications maintain Gary-Zero's cloud-native, agent-focused architecture while serving user needs effectively.
