#### Multi-Agent Orchestration & Role Mapping (Step 6 - COMPLETED)

**Agent Hierarchy:**
- Root Agent: Coordinates activities and monitors other agents
- Coordinator Agents: Manage specific domains (security, development, operations)
- Worker Agents: Execute individual tasks based on specialization (code review, deployment)
- Utility Agents: Provide auxiliary functions (logging, notifications)

**MCP Protocol Usage:**
- Initialization: Agents authenticate and register capabilities with the MCP
- Task Requests: Agents use MCP to request data, delegate tasks, and access external tools
- State Monitoring: Agents periodically report status via MCP for centralized tracking

**Task Delegation Algorithm:**
1. Task Analysis: Determine task category and complexity
2. Agent Matching: Select appropriate agent based on specialization and availability
3. Delegation: Assign task to the selected agent with a specific deadline
4. Monitoring: Track task progress and completion using the MCP

**Memory-Sharing Rules:**
- Data Centralization: Use a centralized memory store accessible via the MCP for shared data
- Data Access Control: Implement access controls based on roles to ensure security
- Update Protocols: Agents commit updates after validation and conflict resolution

**Role-to-Persona Mapping Matrix:**
| Role                       | Persona                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Security Specialist        | Cyber Guardian          |
| Development Lead           | Code Architect          |
| Operations Manager         | System Steward          |
| Quality Assurance Reviewer | Test Maestro            |
| Deployment Engineer        | DevOps Catalyst         |

**State Machine Diagrams:**
Agent Lifecycle:
1. Idle: Waiting for task
2. Assigned: Task received
3. Working: Task in progress
4. Completed: Task completed and verified
5. Failed: Error handling initiated

**Failure Handling and Circuit-Breaker Logic:**
- Error Detection: Identify failure types (transient vs. persistent)
- Retry Mechanism: Implement exponential backoff for transient errors
- Alerting: Notify relevant personnel for persistent issues
- Circuit Breaker: Temporarily halt task processing in case of repeated failures to prevent overload

**Circuit-Breaker Logic:**
- Open: On high error rates, trip the breaker to prevent more tasks
- Half-Open: Test the system periodically with a limited number of tasks
- Closed: Resume full operation upon success of the test tasks
