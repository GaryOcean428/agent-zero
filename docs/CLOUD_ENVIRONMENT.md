```bash
MORPHISM_BROWSER_URL="https://${{morphism-browser.RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Automated web testing
- Data extraction
- Web form automation
- Dynamic content interaction


## Environment Compensations

### Traditional Desktop â†’ Cloud Equivalents

| Traditional Capability | Cloud Compensation | Service |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Local terminal access | Kali Linux SSH service | Railway Kali |
| Code execution | E2B sandboxes | E2B Cloud |
| Desktop automation | Computer Use API | Anthropic |
| Browser automation | Morphism service | Railway Browser |
| File system access | Cloud storage + APIs | Railway + E2B |
| Network tools | Kali security suite | Railway Kali |

### Security Benefits

1. **Isolation**: Each service runs in isolated environments
2. **Scalability**: Cloud resources scale based on demand
3. **Consistency**: Same environment across all deployments
4. **Auditability**: All actions logged and traceable
5. **Access Control**: Service-level authentication and authorization

### Performance Benefits

1. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple services can run simultaneously
2. **Resource Optimization**: Services only consume resources when needed
3. **Geographic Distribution**: Services can be deployed closer to users
4. **Load Balancing**: Railway handles traffic distribution


## Service Communication

### Railway Private Networking

Services communicate through Railway's internal network:

```bash
# Internal service URLs
http://gary-zero.railway.internal:8000
http://kali-linux-docker.railway.internal:8080
http://morphism-browser.railway.internal:3000
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Service Discovery**: Main app discovers available services
2. **Authentication**: Services authenticate using shared credentials
3. **Communication**: Secure API calls over private network
4. **Response**: Structured JSON responses with error handling

### Error Handling

- **Service Unavailable**: Graceful degradation when services are offline
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for all service calls
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures


## Development Workflow

### Local Development

For local development, developers can:
1. Run Gary-Zero locally with mock services
2. Connect to staging cloud services
3. Use Docker Compose for local service simulation

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual service integrations
- **Integration Tests**: Test service-to-service communication
