# Gary-Zero 24-Hour Log Monitoring Setup


## Overview

A comprehensive 24-hour log monitoring system has been set up for Gary-Zero production deployment on Railway. This system monitors for 4xx/5xx HTTP error spikes and generates detailed reports.


## Current Status

✅ **ACTIVE MONITORING RUNNING**

- **Start Time**: 2025-07-24 16:50:28 UTC
- **Duration**: 24 hours (until 2025-07-25 16:50:28 UTC)
- **Check Interval**: Every 5 minutes
- **Process ID**: 280063


## Monitoring Components

### 1. Core Monitoring Script

- **File**: `scripts/log_monitor_24h.py`
- **Function**: Continuously monitors Railway logs for HTTP error patterns
- **Alert Thresholds**:
  - Total error spike: >50 errors per 5-minute check
  - Individual status code spike: >20 occurrences per check
- **Output**: Real-time status updates and final JSON report

### 2. Management Script

- **File**: `scripts/start_monitoring.sh`
- **Function**: Manages the monitoring process (start/stop/status/logs)
- **Features**: Background process management, log tailing, status checking

### 3. Log Files

- **Monitor Output**: `scripts/monitor_output.log`
- **Process ID**: `scripts/monitor.pid`
- **Final Report**: `log_monitor_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`


## Management Commands

```bash
# Check monitoring status
scripts/start_monitoring.sh status

# View all monitoring output
scripts/start_monitoring.sh logs

# Follow monitoring output in real-time
scripts/start_monitoring.sh tail

# Stop monitoring (if needed)
scripts/start_monitoring.sh stop
```


## What's Being Monitored

### Error Detection Patterns

- 4xx HTTP status codes (client errors)
- 5xx HTTP status codes (server errors)
- Common log patterns for HTTP status codes
- Gunicorn access logs
- Railway deployment logs

### Alert Conditions

- **High Error Spike**: >50 total 4xx/5xx errors in a 5-minute period
- **Status Code Spike**: >20 occurrences of any specific status code
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Every 5 minutes for 24 hours (288 total checks)


## Expected Behavior

Based on the current production deployment:

1. **Normal Operation**: The application is running in emergency mode due to security-enforced default credential blocking
2. **Expected Errors**: Minimal 4xx/5xx errors expected since most functionality is disabled in emergency mode
3. **Security Features**: The application correctly blocks access with default admin/admin credentials
4. **Health Endpoint**: Basic health checks are operational and should show no errors


## Monitoring Results (So Far)

- **First Check (16:50:38)**: ✅ No 4xx/5xx errors detected
- **Status**: All green, no alerts
- **Security**: Production is correctly rejecting default credentials


## Final Report

After 24 hours, the monitoring will automatically generate:

1. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Total checks performed (expected: 288)
   - Total 4xx/5xx errors detected
   - Maximum errors in any single check
   - Number of alert periods

2. **Detailed JSON Report**:
   - Timestamped data for each check
   - Error breakdown by status code
   - Alert history
   - Complete monitoring timeline


## Post-Monitoring Actions

After the 24-hour period completes:

1. **Review Final Report**: Check `log_monitor_report_*.json` for comprehensive analysis
2. **Assess Stability**: Confirm no error spikes occurred during monitoring period
3. **Production Health**: Verify production deployment remained stable
4. **Documentation**: Archive monitoring results for future reference


## Current Production State

- **Environment**: Railway Production
- **Application**: Gary-Zero in emergency/security mode
- **Authentication**: Correctly blocks default credentials (admin/admin)
- **Health**: Basic health endpoint operational
- **Security**: ✅ Basic Auth header "YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" properly rejected

**Note**: This monitoring setup fulfills the requirement from Step 10 of the deployment plan: "Monitor logs 24h for 4xx/5xx spikes." The system is now actively monitoring and will provide a comprehensive report upon completion.
