# Deployment Guides Consolidated

To streamline the deployment procedure, we have unified the documentation regarding deployment processes for Gary-Zero. This should serve as a definitive guide.

## Deployment Overview

Deployment can be executed locally for development purposes, utilizing Docker for containerization, or leveraging Railway for cloud-native application deployment.

## Basic Deployment Steps

- **1. Railway Deployment**
  - Connect GitHub repository to Railway.
  - Configure environment variables.
  - Deploy using the `railway.toml` configuration.
  - Monitor logs.
- Environment Variables:
  - `DATABASE_URL`, `NODE_ENV` set to production.

- **2. Docker Deployment**
  - Build the image with `docker build`.
  - Run with necessary environment variables using `docker run`.

## Detailed Procedures

### Local Deployment

Setting up a local environment with essential dependencies and development server launch.

### Docker

Includes building the Docker image and running it locally or in cloud hosting environments.

### Railway

Utilizes Railway's infrastructure with specific configurations for Gary-Zero application.

### Production Deployment

Focus on production environment optimizations, security practices, and scalability.

## Advanced Configurations

### Volume Management

Details managing persistent volumes in Railway.

### Health Checks

Describes periodically health-checking endpoints for application.

This guide replaces `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`, and `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` to provide a streamlined and unified deployment process overview for all supported environments.
