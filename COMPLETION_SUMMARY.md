### Quick Start
```python
from framework.container import get_container
from framework.security import InputValidator, RateLimiter

# Initialize framework
container = get_container()
await container.initialize_services()

# Use security features
validator = InputValidator()
rate_limiter = RateLimiter()

# Use performance features
@cached(ttl=300)
@timer("expensive_operation")
def expensive_function():
    # Your code here
    pass
