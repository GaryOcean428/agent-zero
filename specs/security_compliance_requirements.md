# Security & Compliance Requirements Specification

## Environment-Variable-Only Secret Management

- **Principle**: All sensitive data, including API keys, tokens, and credentials, must be handled exclusively through environment variables to ensure secrets are not hard-coded or committed to version control.
- **Implementation**: Use tools like `dotenv` for local development and configure deployment environments to inject necessary variables.

## Railway Config Quick-Check

Embed the user's reference variable checklist:

### 1. Pull the latest code
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Open the three files that matter
- `railway.toml` or `railway.json`
- `Dockerfile` (if used)
- Your main entry file (`server.js`, `app.py`, etc.)

### 3. Find or add the port line
- Use `$PORT` or equivalent environment variable for binding.

### 4. Verify inter-service URLs
- Replace hard-coded hostnames with Railway reference variables.

### 5. CORS quick-scan (backend)
- Ensure proper origin validation.

### 6. WebSocket sanity check
- Match protocol between frontend and WebSocket URL.

### 7. Dockerfile (if used)
- Utilize `ARG PORT` and `EXPOSE ${PORT}`.

### 8. Deploy & test loop
- Confirm setup via logs and public URLs.

### Conflict Check
- Ensure that if `railpack.json` is present, `railway.toml` or `railway.json` must not be present to avoid conflicts.

## Authentication Flows & Least-Privilege RBAC

- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Implement MFA where applicable to add an extra layer of security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Apply least-privilege principles to grant necessary access rights only.
- **Network ACLs**: Configure ingress and egress rules to restrict external access.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Security Gates

- **Linting**: Ensure code quality through automated lint checks.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Use tools like `safety` and `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Container Scanning**: Implement `Trivy` for scanning container images for vulnerabilities.

## Threat Model & Common Mitigations

- **Threat Model**: Identify potential threats and assess their impact and likelihood.
- **Common Mitigations**:
  - **Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - **Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and encrypt sensitive data at rest.
  - **Logging & Monitoring**: Implement logging on essential actions and set up alerts for suspicious activities.
